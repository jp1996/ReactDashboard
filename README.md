#React Dashboard

This is a react dashboard that was created in Javascript, HTML and CSS, using technologies and frameworks such as ReactJS, TailwindCSS, and Syncfusion. This does not connect to a live backend server, all data is static and only is stage data to demonstrate a Saleforce-like dashboard, and to showcase development skills.
